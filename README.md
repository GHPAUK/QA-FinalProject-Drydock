# QA-FinalProject-Drydock

#### This repo houses my final project source code and deliverable for the QA Bootcamp I have attended

### What am I doing and why?

I have been attenting a QA Coding Bootcamp and have been issued with a final project to demonstrate the skills I have gained throughout. My completed project will aim to cover all of the areas studied during the bootcamp and will be documented accordingly below.

### How I expected the challenge to go

I expect I will be able to provide a satisfactory end result to the projects brief with the inclusion of some stretch goals that have been set, if not all. My biggest concern with the project and its completion is the documentation and the level of detail necessary. To circumvent this concern I have made the decision to break down the five day project into a number of 'sprints' (while acknowledging a traditional sprint is two weeks), this should not only help to illustrate my competency with Jira software, but will also serve me as a reminder to document and manage my continuous integration (with git version control) as my application develops.

## Project Overview

Your objective with this project is to achieve the following:

To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training.

Specifically, you are required to create a Spring Boot API using:

    An application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
    
    A managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider examined during your Cloud Fundamentals module (e.g. H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
    
    A means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)

## Project Scenario

In this projects scenario I imagine I have been tasked as an employee of a Drydock to implement a new order management system which should utilise a Rest API application as a backend written in Java.

The Application must include the minimum CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and handle HTTP requests to perform basic tasks such as create an order and commit said order to a database for data persistence.
