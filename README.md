# QA-FinalProject-Drydock

####### This repo houses my final project source code and deliverable for the QA Bootcamp I have attended
---

#### Overview
---
Your objective with this project is to achieve the following:

To create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training.

Specifically, you are required to create a Spring Boot API using:

    * An application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
    * A managed database hosted locally or within the Cloud Provider examined during your Cloud Fundamentals module (e.g. H2 or MySQL (local / GCP)
    * a means of making API calls (Postman) and a means of checking persistence (Workbench/H2 console)
---

####Scenario
---
In this projects scenario I imagine I have been tasked as an employee of a Drydock to implement a new order management system which should utilise a Rest API application as a backend written in Java.

The Application must include the minimum CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and handle HTTP requests to perform basic tasks such as create an order and commit said order to a database for data persistence.
